## <a name="about_me">Who am I?🐺</a>

Naval Ravikant once said " No one can compete with you on being you." Unashamably I am an energetic, inquisitive ball of enthusiasm that is on a quest to continue to improve, failing along the way but learning from those failures. My journey as a solftware engineer has shown me there is a right way to fail. 

Having previously venture into Law and Development, no other career could quite satisfy my urge to learn than the software engineering space.
