The Makers Academy Software Development course solidified my confidence with this skill by constantly pushing challenges that tested technical and logical thinking; I continuously commit similar challenges on [Github](...).


***Self-motivated***<br>
Now that I am developing and maintaining software, my enthusiasm is boundless. I am eager to learn as much as possible and continue improving as a developer. I am excited to work on new challenges, gain new knowledge and use my existing skills to enhance my future projects.

I am continuing my personal development through the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), and I plan to use React JS to build a new art portfolio. I love that there is always something to learn within the software industry, as long as you have the motivation to do so.
